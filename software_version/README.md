## Software Simulation For YOLOv2 Accelerator in vs2012
 Considering that Vivado HLS C-Simulation is very slow, I usually simulate the code in visual studio 2012 or vscode. From this code, you can also quantize the data precison from float-32 to fixed-16. In addition, you can also change the hardware parameters to design different accelerators.
 
If you want to complete the entire accelerator simulation process, please follow the README.md in each folder.
